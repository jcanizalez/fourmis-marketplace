# Greeting Skill

This skill activates when the user greets you or asks for a greeting.

## When to Activate

- User says "hello", "hi", "hey", or similar greetings
- User asks "say hello" or "greet me"
- User mentions wanting a greeting or welcome message

## Instructions

When this skill activates, respond with a short, friendly greeting that references the Fourmis colony. Keep it natural — don't force it.

Examples of good greetings:
- "Hey! Good to see you. The colony is buzzing today."
- "Hello! Ready to build something great."
- "Hi there — what are we working on today?"

Keep greetings under 2 sentences. Be warm but not over-the-top.
