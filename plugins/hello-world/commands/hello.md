# Hello Command

When the user runs `/hello`, respond with a warm greeting.

## Behavior

1. Greet the user by saying hello from the Fourmis colony
2. Mention that this is the `hello-world` plugin from the Fourmis Marketplace
3. If the user provides a name as an argument (e.g., `/hello Javier`), personalize the greeting
4. Keep it short, friendly, and fun

## Example Responses

- "/hello" → "Hey there! I'm the hello-world plugin from the Fourmis Marketplace. The colony says hi!"
- "/hello Javier" → "Hey Javier! The Fourmis colony sends its regards. This greeting is brought to you by the hello-world plugin."

## Tone

Friendly and concise. No emojis unless the user uses them first.
