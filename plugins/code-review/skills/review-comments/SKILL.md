# Review Comments

How to write effective, constructive, and actionable code review comments. Covers comment structure, tone, categorization, and common anti-patterns.

## When to Activate

When the user asks to:
- Write review comments for a PR
- Provide feedback on code changes
- Comment on specific code issues
- Improve their review comment style

## Comment Structure

Every review comment should follow this format:

```
[Category] Brief description of the issue

Explanation of why this matters.

Suggested fix or alternative approach.
```

### Example

```
[Bug] Off-by-one error in pagination

The `skip` calculation uses `page * limit` but pages are 1-indexed,
so page 1 skips the first `limit` records.

Suggestion:
  const skip = (page - 1) * limit;
```

## Comment Categories

Use these prefixes to classify comments:

| Prefix | Meaning | Blocking? |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **[Bug]** | Incorrect behavior, logic error | ✅ Yes |
| **[Security]** | Security vulnerability | ✅ Yes |
| **[Perf]** | Performance issue | Depends |
| **[Nit]** | Style, formatting, minor preference | ❌ No |
| **[Question]** | Need clarification on intent | ❌ No |
| **[Suggestion]** | Alternative approach, improvement idea | ❌ No |
| **[Praise]** | Positive feedback, well-done code | ❌ No |
| **[TODO]** | Acknowledge tech debt, track for later | ❌ No |

## Effective Comment Examples

### Bug Report
```
[Bug] `findUser` returns null but caller doesn't check

Line 42: `const user = findUser(id)` — if the user doesn't exist,
`findUser` returns null, but line 43 immediately accesses
`user.email` which will throw.

Fix:
  const user = findUser(id);
  if (!user) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
```

### Security Issue
```
[Security] User input directly in SQL query

This query interpolates `req.params.id` directly:
  `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${id}'`

This is a SQL injection vulnerability. Use parameterized queries:
  db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id])
```

### Constructive Suggestion
```
[Suggestion] Consider extracting this into a utility function

This date formatting logic appears in 3 files (here, orders.ts,
and reports.ts). Extracting to a shared `formatDate()` utility
would reduce duplication and ensure consistent formatting.
```

### Positive Feedback
```
[Praise] Great error handling here

The retry logic with exponential backoff is well-implemented.
Clean separation between transient and permanent errors. 👍
```

### Non-Blocking Nit
```
[Nit] Could use optional chaining here

  const name = user && user.profile && user.profile.name;

Could be simplified to:
  const name = user?.profile?.name;

Not blocking — just a readability improvement.
```

## Comment Tone Guidelines

### Do
- Be specific — point to exact lines and explain why
- Be constructive — suggest fixes, not just problems
- Be kind — assume the author's best intent
- Ask questions when unsure — "Is this intentional?"
- Praise good work — positive feedback matters
- Explain the "why" — not just "change this"
- Use "we" language — "we should handle this case" vs "you missed this"

### Don't
- Be vague — "this needs work" (what specifically?)
- Be condescending — "obviously this is wrong"
- Nitpick everything — focus on what matters
- Make it personal — "you always do this"
- Block on style preferences — use a linter instead
- Leave only negative comments — balance with positives
- Write essays — keep comments concise

## Comment Volume Guidelines

| PR Size | Target Comments |
|---------|----------------|
| XS (1-10 lines) | 0-2 comments |
| S (11-50 lines) | 1-5 comments |
| M (51-200 lines) | 3-10 comments |
| L (201-400 lines) | 5-15 comments |
| XL (400+) | 10-20 + suggest splitting |
