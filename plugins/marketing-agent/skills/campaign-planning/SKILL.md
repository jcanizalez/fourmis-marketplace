# Campaign Planning

Structured approach to planning content marketing campaigns — from product launches to ongoing content series. Activate when the user needs to plan a coordinated marketing effort across multiple pieces of content and channels.

## When to Activate

Activate when the user:
- Plans a product launch or feature announcement
- Wants to create a content series or campaign
- Needs a content calendar or editorial plan
- Mentions "launch plan", "campaign", "content calendar", "marketing push"
