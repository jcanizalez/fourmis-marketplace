## Content Types by Goal

| Goal | Content Type | Frequency | Effort |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Awareness | Blog posts, social threads | 2-4x/week | Medium |
| Authority | Technical deep-dives, tutorials | 1-2x/month | High |
| Engagement | Questions, polls, discussions | Daily | Low |
| Conversion | Landing pages, case studies | As needed | High |
| Retention | Changelogs, tips, community posts | Weekly | Low |

## Content Pillars Framework

Every content strategy should have 3-5 pillars:

| Pillar | Purpose | Example (Dev Tool) |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Educational | Teach your audience | "How to optimize Docker builds" |
| Product | Show what you built | "New feature: auto-scaling" |
| Community | Build relationships | "What's your deployment workflow?" |
| Industry | Share market knowledge | "State of DevOps 2026" |
| Behind-the-scenes | Build trust | "Why we rewrote our API" |

### Pillar Ratio
- **60%** Educational (build audience trust)
- **20%** Product (show your value)
- **10%** Community (drive engagement)
- **10%** Industry/BTS (establish authority)

## Distribution Strategy

### Owned Channels
- Blog / Website (pillar content lives here)
- Email newsletter (highest conversion channel)
- README / Documentation (often overlooked)

### Social Channels
- **Bluesky**: Tech-forward, early adopter audience. Short, punchy content. Growing fast.
- **Mastodon**: Thoughtful, long-form friendly. FOSS and privacy-focused. Hashtags essential.
- **Reddit**: Community discussions. Value-first, never promotional. Subreddit-specific norms.
- **Hacker News**: Developer audience. Technical content only. Don't self-promote too aggressively.

### Distribution Rule of Thirds
- **1/3 original** — content you create
- **1/3 curated** — share others' great content (builds relationships)
- **1/3 engagement** — reply, discuss, contribute to conversations

## Measuring What Matters

### Leading Indicators (Week 1-4)
- Content published per week
- Social followers growth rate
- Post engagement (likes, replies, reposts)
- Website traffic from social

### Lagging Indicators (Month 2+)
- Email subscribers
- Organic search impressions / clicks
- Referral traffic from content
- Conversion rate (reader → user)

### What NOT to Measure
- Vanity metrics (total followers without engagement)
- Output volume without quality
- Revenue attribution too early (content marketing is a 3-6 month investment)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Posting only about your product | Follow the 60/20/10/10 pillar ratio |
| Inconsistent schedule | Start smaller (2x/week) and be reliable |
| Same content on every platform | Adapt tone and format for each platform |
| No CTA | Every piece should have a clear next step |
| Writing for search engines, not people | Write for humans first, optimize for SEO second |
| Giving up after 2 weeks | Content marketing compounds over 3-6 months |
